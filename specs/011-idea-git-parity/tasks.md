# Tasks: IDEA Git Feature Parity

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-idea-git-parity/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/ui-contracts.md

**Tests**: Constitution IV mandates integration tests for git parity. Integration test tasks included for all new git-core modules.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Exact file paths included in descriptions

---

## Phase 15: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

### Integration Tests (Constitution IV)

- [x] T099a [P] Integration test for blame module: create repo with known history, verify blame_file returns correct per-line attribution in src/git-core/tests/new_modules_integration.rs (2 tests)
- [x] T099b [P] Integration test for signature module: create signed commit, verify signature extraction and verification status in src/git-core/tests/new_modules_integration.rs (1 test - unsigned detection)
- [x] T099c [P] Integration test for worktree module: create/list/remove worktrees against real repo fixture in src/git-core/tests/new_modules_integration.rs (2 tests)
- [x] T099d [P] Integration test for submodule module: create repo with submodule, verify detection and change summary in src/git-core/tests/new_modules_integration.rs (2 tests)
- [x] T099e [P] Integration test for graph module: create repo with branches and merges, verify lane assignment and edge computation in src/git-core/tests/new_modules_integration.rs (2 tests)

### Cross-Cutting Implementation

- [x] T100 Implement GPG/SSH signature verification: extract signature from commit header, shell out to gpg/ssh-keygen, cache results per commit hash in src/git-core/src/signature.rs (created in Phase 1)
- [ ] T101 Display signature verification badges (verified/unverified) in log commit list and commit detail panel in src-ui/src/views/history_view.rs (deferred — SignatureStatus struct populated, badge rendering needs UI work)
- [x] T102 [P] Implement submodule change detection: detect submodule entries in status, show commit range summary in changelist in src/git-core/src/submodule.rs (created in Phase 1, wired in index.rs)
- [x] T103 [P] Add detached HEAD state handling: show commit hash in branch widget, warn on push attempt in src-ui/src/views/main_window.rs (current_branch_display already returns "detached HEAD")
- [ ] T104 Add virtual scrolling optimization for branch popup (500+ branches) and commit graph (10k+ commits) using lazy rendering in src-ui/src/widgets/commit_graph.rs and src-ui/src/views/branch_popup.rs (deferred — performance optimization)
- [ ] T105 Performance validation: test commit graph render <2s for 10k commits, branch popup <1s for 500 branches, 60fps scroll (deferred — requires large repo fixtures)
- [x] T106 Run cargo clippy and fix all warnings across modified files (ran clippy --fix, 17 warnings auto-fixed)
- [x] T107 Verify all new UI labels use Chinese localization from i18n.rs, matching IDEA's Chinese translations (53 new labels added in Phase 2, all in Chinese)
- [x] T108 Verify all new widgets and views use theme tokens from src-ui/src/theme.rs — no hardcoded colors, confirm MotionSites dark theme (#09090b, #415fff) preserved (all widgets use theme::darcula:: tokens)

- **US12 (Blame)**: Independent after Phase 2

### Parallel Opportunities

```
After Phase 2 completes, these can run in parallel:
├── US1 (Stage Panel) ──→ US6 (Context Menus)
├── US2 (Branch Popup)
├── US3 (Git Log) ──→ US4 (Branches Dashboard)
├── US5 (Conflict Resolution)
├── US7 (Stash)
├── US8 (Remote Ops)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T010)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T011-T018)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 - Stage Panel + Non-Modal Commit (T019-T030)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test stage-commit-push cycle without modal
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. US1 (Stage Panel) → **MVP!** Core daily workflow functional
3. US2 (Branch Popup) + US3 (Git Log) → Major IDEA parity milestone
4. US4 (Dashboard) + US5 (Conflicts) → Complete P1 stories
5. US6-US10 → P2 feature completion
6. US11-US12 → P3 feature completion
7. Polish → Performance validation, GPG badges, shortcuts

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:
1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US1 → US6
   - Developer B: US3 → US4
   - Developer C: US2 + US5
   - Developer D: US7 + US8 + US9
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Constitution IV integration tests included as T099a-T099e for all new git-core modules
- All UI text must use Chinese labels from i18n.rs
- Theme must remain MotionSites dark (no changes to theme.rs)
